# bridgmodel

In this project, we developed and evaluated a Semantic Web-based approach that integrates the BRIDG model with ISO 21090 data types to generate domain-specific templates to support clinical study metadata standards development. 

A prototype of the application is available at: http://informatics.mayo.edu/bridgmodel/
